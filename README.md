# Dainyl Cua's Advent of Code

I decided to take on the Advent of Code as a way to keep my JavaScript coding skills up to snuff!

The code is not the cleanest nor most optimized, but all solutions that are pushed are valid unless stated otherwise.

If you'd like to join, check out the Advent of Code for 2021 [here!](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
